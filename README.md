UCF numerical calculus intro assignment

The only library dependency for this program is numpy, with the version given in the requirements.txt

I installed Python 3.11.1 using the installer given on the Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/

I was able to execute the script on Windows by running the following commands from the project directory
within the command prompt. First command needed to be run only once to download dependencies using pip.
Second command executed the script within the python executable

pip install -r requirements.txt

python.exe src\main\intro_to_python.py
