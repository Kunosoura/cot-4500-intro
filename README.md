# cot-4500-intro
UCF numerical calculus intro assignment

The only library dependency for this program is numpy, with the version given in the requirements.txt

I installed Python 3.11.1 using the installer given on the Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/
As a note, windows seems to have python packaged with it? I didn't know that. The Python install was still very
useful for the included package manager.

I was able to execute the script on Windows by running the following commands from the project directory
within the command prompt. First command needed to be run only once to download dependencies using pip.
The second command executes the script with the python executable.

pip install -r requirements.txt

python.exe src\main\intro_to_python.py

Results were verified to match the expected output
